The project provides controls for building web parts and extensions. Attention In order to migrate to v3 it is advised to follow this guide: Migrating from V1 . Library Versions \u00b6 Currently there are 3 active versions of the controls. Please, reference the table below to see what version to use in your project. Version SPFx minimal dependency Fluent UI (Office UI Fabric React) version SharePoint Version Comments v3 1.13.* 7.174.1 Online The most current, actively maintained version of the library. v2 1.11.0 6.214.0 Online The last major version is 2.9.0 . We strongly recommend to update to SPFx 1.13.* and v3 of Controls. v1 1.3.0 5.131.0 On-Prem The version is maintained for SharePoint On-Prem 2016 and 2019 implementations. Be aware that the controls might not work in solutions you're building for on-premises as SharePoint On-Prem is based on SPFx 1.1.0 . Attention If you are using v3 of the Controls with SPFx 1.12.1 you will need to cast web part context to any to pass it to the controls. Getting started \u00b6 Installation \u00b6 To get started you have to install the following dependency to your project: @pnp/spfx-controls-react . Enter the following command to install the dependency to your project: npm install @pnp/spfx-controls-react --save --save-exact Configuration \u00b6 Note Since v1.4.0 the localized resource path will automatically be configured during the dependency installing. Once the package is installed, you will have to configure the resource file of the property controls to be used in your project. You can do this by opening the config/config.json and adding the following line to the localizedResources property: \"ControlStrings\" : \"node_modules/@pnp/spfx-controls-react/lib/loc/{locale}.js\" Telemetry \u00b6 All controls gather telemetry to verify the usage. Only the name of the control and related data gets captured. More information about the service that we are using for this can be found here: PnP Telemetry Proxy . Since version 1.17.0 it is possible to opt-out of the telemetry by adding the following code to your web part: import PnPTelemetry from \"@pnp/telemetry-js\" ; ... const telemetry = PnPTelemetry . getInstance (); telemetry . optOut (); Available controls \u00b6 The following controls are currently available: AccessibleAccordion (renders an accordion.

It offers most of the functionality available with Chart.js. The control automatically renders responsive charts, uses the environment's theme colors, and renders a hidden table for users with impaired vision. Here is an example of the control in action: How to use this control in your solutions \u00b6 Check that you installed the @pnp/spfx-controls-react dependency. Check out the getting started page for more information about installing the dependency. Import the following module to your component: import { ChartControl , ChartType } from '@pnp/spfx-controls-react/lib/ChartControl' ; Use the ChartControl control in your code as follows: < ChartControl type = { ChartType . Bar } data = {{ labels : [ 'January' , 'February' , 'March' , 'April' , 'May' , 'June' , 'July' ], datasets : [{ label : 'My First dataset' , data : [ 65 , 59 , 80 , 81 , 56 , 55 , 40 ] }] }} /> Compatibility with Chart.js \u00b6 The majority of Chart.js its options like data , options , type , and plugins will work the same way as is -- except that you use TypeScript syntax. To find sample code that you can use, visit the Chart.Js documentation . For example, to reproduce following Javascript code sample from Chart.js : < canvas id = \"myChart\" width = \"400\" height = \"400\" ></ canvas > < script > var ctx = document . getElementById ( \"myChart\" ). getContext ( '2d' ); var myChart = new Chart ( ctx , { type : 'bar' , data : { labels : [ \"Red\" , \"Blue\" , \"Yellow\" , \"Green\" , \"Purple\" , \"Orange\" ], datasets : [{ label : '# of Votes' , data : [ 12 , 19 , 3 , 5 , 2 , 3 ], backgroundColor : [ 'rgba(255, 99, 132, 0.2)' , 'rgba(54, 162, 235, 0.2)' , 'rgba(255, 206, 86, 0.2)' , 'rgba(75, 192, 192, 0.2)' , 'rgba(153, 102, 255, 0.2)' , 'rgba(255, 159, 64, 0.2)' ], borderColor : [ 'rgba(255,99,132,1)' , 'rgba(54, 162, 235, 1)' , 'rgba(255, 206, 86, 1)' , 'rgba(75, 192, 192, 1)' , 'rgba(153, 102, 255, 1)' , 'rgba(255, 159, 64, 1)' ], borderWidth : 1 }] }, options : { scales : { yAxes : [{ ticks : { beginAtZero : true } }] } } }); </ script > You would use the following Typescript code: < ChartControl type = { ChartType . Bar } data = {{ labels : [ \"Red\" , \"Blue\" , \"Yellow\" , \"Green\" , \"Purple\" , \"Orange\" ], datasets : [{ label : '# of Votes' , data : [ 12 , 19 , 3 , 5 , 2 , 3 ], backgroundColor : [ 'rgba(255, 99, 132, 0.2)' , 'rgba(54, 162, 235, 0.2)' , 'rgba(255, 206, 86, 0.2)' , 'rgba(75, 192, 192, 0.2)' , 'rgba(153, 102, 255, 0.2)' , 'rgba(255, 159, 64, 0.2)' ], borderColor : [ 'rgba(255,99,132,1)' , 'rgba(54, 162, 235, 1)' , 'rgba(255, 206, 86, 1)' , 'rgba(75, 192, 192, 1)' , 'rgba(153, 102, 255, 1)' , 'rgba(255, 159, 64, 1)' ], borderWidth : 1 }] }} options = {{ scales : { yAxes : [{ ticks : { beginAtZero : true } }] } }} /> The code above will produce the following chart: Specifying Data \u00b6 The data property typically consist of: labels : (Optional) An array of strings providing the data labels (e.g.: ['January', 'February', 'March', 'April', 'May', 'June', 'July'] ) datasets : At least one dataset, which contains: label : (Optional) A label for the data (e.g.: 'My First Dataset' ) data : An array of numbers (e.g.: [65, 59, 80, 81, 56, 55, 40] ) See below for more information on what types of data are required for each type of chart. Specifying Data Promises \u00b6 The ChartControl makes it easy to retrieve data asynchronously with the datapromise property. To use datapromise , add a function to your web part that returns a Promise<Chart.ChartData> as follows: private _loadAsyncData () : Promise < Chart . ChartData > { return new Promise < Chart . ChartData > (( resolve , reject ) => { // Call your own service -- this example returns an array of numbers // but you could call const dataProvider : IChartDataProvider = new MockChartDataProvider (); dataProvider . getNumberArray (). then (( numbers : number []) => { // format your response to ChartData const data : Chart.ChartData = { labels : [ 'January' , 'February' , 'March' , 'April' , 'May' , 'June' , 'July' ] datasets : [ { label : 'My First dataset' , data : numbers } ] }; // resolve the promise resolve ( data ); }); }); } Then, instead of passing a data property, pass your function to the datapromise property, as follows: < ChartControl type = 'bar' datapromise = { this . _loadAsyncData ()} /> If you want, you provide a template to display until the datapromise is resolved, as follows: < ChartControl type = 'bar' datapromise = { this . _loadAsyncData ()} loadingtemplate = {() => < div > Please wait ... < /div>} /> You can provide full React controls within the loadingtemplate . For example, to use the Office UI Fabric Spinner control, you would use the following code: import { Spinner , SpinnerSize } from 'office-ui-fabric-react/lib/Spinner' ; ... < ChartControl type = 'bar' datapromise = { this . _loadAsyncData ()} loadingtemplate = {() => < Spinner size = { SpinnerSize . large } label = \"Loading...\" /> } /> You can also provide another template to display when the datapromise is rejected, as follows: < ChartControl type = 'bar' datapromise = { this . _loadAsyncData ()} loadingtemplate = {() => < Spinner size = { SpinnerSize . large } label = \"Loading...\" /> } rejectedtemplate = {( error : string ) => < div > Something went wrong : { error } < /div>} /> Theme Color Support \u00b6 By default, the ChartControl will attempt to use the environment theme colors and fonts for elements such as the chart background color, grid lines, titles, labels, legends, and tooltips. This includes support for dark themes and high contrast themes. If you wish, you can disable the use of themes by setting the useTheme property to false . Doing so will use the standard Chart.js colors and fonts. Office Color Palettes \u00b6 You can also simplify the majority of code samples by omitting the color properties; the ChartControl will automatically reproduce the color palette that you would get if you used Office to create the chart. < ChartControl type = { ChartType . Bar } data = {{ labels : [ \"Red\" , \"Blue\" , \"Yellow\" , \"Green\" , \"Purple\" , \"Orange\" ], datasets : [{ label : '# of Votes' , data : [ 12 , 19 , 3 , 5 , 2 , 3 ] }] }} options = {{ scales : { yAxes : [{ ticks : { beginAtZero : true } }] } }} /> You can also set the palette property to choose one of the Office color palettes. For example, Specifying ChartPalette.OfficeMonochromatic1 will produce the following chart: Responsiveness \u00b6 The ChartControl will automatically expand to fit its container. If you wish to control the size of the chart, set its parent container size, or use the className property to pass your own CSS class and override the dimensions within that class. Accessibility \u00b6 As long as you provide labels for all your data elements, the ChartControl will render a hidden table. Users who are visually impaired and use a screen reader will hear a description of the data in the chart. You can improve the accessible table by adding an alternateText , a caption and a summary . If you do not provide a caption , the control will attempt to use the chart's title. For example: < ChartControl type = { ChartType . Bar } accessible = {{ alternateText : 'Text alternative for this canvas graphic is in the data table below.' , summary : 'This is the text alternative for the canvas graphic.' , caption : 'Votes for favorite pets' }} data = {{ labels : [ \"Dog\" , \"Cat\" , \"Hamster\" , \"Gerbil\" , \"Hedgehog\" , \"Platypus\" ], datasets : [{ label : '# of Votes' , data : [ 12 , 19 , 3 , 5 , 2 , 3 ] }] }} options = {{ scales : { yAxes : [{ ticks : { beginAtZero : true } }] } }} /> Implementation \u00b6 ChartControl Properties \u00b6 The ChartControl can be configured with the following properties: Property Type Required Description accessibility IChartAccessibility no Optional property to specify the accessibility options. className string no Optional property to specify a custom class that allows you to change the chart's styles. data ChartData no The data you wish to display. datapromise Promise no The promise to load data asynchronously. Use with loadingtemplate and rejectedtemplate loadingtemplate JSX.Element () => JSX.Element no The HTML to display while waiting to resolve the datapromise options ChartOptions no Optional property to set the chart's additional options. palette ChartPalette no Optional property to set the desired Office color palette plugins object[] no Optional property to set an array of objects implementing the IChartPlugin interface rejectedtemplate JSX.Element () => JSX.Element no The HTML to display if the datapromise promise returns an error. useTheme boolean no Optional property to set whether the ChartControl should attempt to use theme colors. Setting it to false will use the standard Chart.js colors and fonts. type ChartType or string yes The type of chart you wish to render. You can also use the string equivalent. onClick (event?: MouseEvent, activeElements?: Array<{}>) => void no Optional callback method that get called when a user clicks on the chart onHover (chart: Chart, event: MouseEvent, activeElements: Array<{}>) => void no Optional callback method that get called when a user hovers the chart onResize (chart: Chart, newSize: ChartSize) => void no Optional callback method that get called when the window containing the ChartControl resizes You can call the following methods to interact with the chart after it has been initialized: Method Type Description clear void Will clear the chart canvas. Used extensively internally between animation frames, but you might find it useful. getCanvas () => HTMLCanvasElement Return the canvass element that contains the chart getChart () => Chart Returns the Chart.js instance getDatasetAtEvent (e: MouseEvent) => Array<{}> Looks for the element under the event point, then returns all elements from that dataset. This is used internally for 'dataset' mode highlighting getElementAtEvent (e: MouseEvent) => {} Calling getElementAtEvent(event) passing an argument of an event will return the single element at the event position. For example, you can use with onClick event handlers. getElementsAtEvent (e: MouseEvent) => Array<{}> Looks for the element under the event point, then returns all elements at the same data index. This is used internally for 'label' mode highlighting. Calling getElementsAtEvent(event) passing an argument of an event will return the point elements that are at that the same position of that event. renderChart (config: {}) => void Triggers a redraw of all chart elements. Note, this does not update elements for new data. Use .update() in that case. stop void Use this to stop any current animation loop. This will pause the chart during any current animation frame. toBase64Image () => string Returns a base 64 encoded string of the chart in it's current state. update (config?: number | boolean | string) => void Triggers an update of the chart. This can be safely called after updating the data object. This will update all scales, legends, and then re-render the chart. ChartType \u00b6 Defines the type of chart that will be rendered. For more information what data structure is required for each type of chart, review the Chart.js documentation ( links below ). Name Chart.js Equivalent Description Bar bar Vertical bar chart Bubble bubble Bubble chart Doughnut doughnut Doughnut chart HorizontalBar horizontalBar Horizontal bar chart Line line Line chart Pie pie Pie chart PolarArea polarArea Polar area chart Radar radar Radar chart Scatter scatter Scatter graph IChartAccessibility \u00b6 The IChartAccessibility interface implements the following properties: Property Type Required Description alternateText string no Optional property to provide an accessible alternate text for the chart. We recommend that you use this property with summary className string no Optional property to specify a custom CSS class for the accessible table. caption string no Optional property to provide a caption for the accessible table. enable boolean no Optional property to turn on or off the rendering of the accessible table. summary string no Optional property to specify the chart's summary.

In order to use a plugin, simply pass an array of objects that implement the IChartPlugin interface to the plugins property of the ChartControl. If a hook is listed as cancellable, you can return false to cancel the event. Property Type Required Description afterDatasetsDraw (chartInstance: Chart, easing: string, options?: {}) => void no Called after the datasets are drawn but after scales are drawn. afterDatasetUpdate (chartInstance: Chart, options?: {}) => void no Called after a dataset was updated. afterDraw (chartInstance: Chart, easing: string, options?: {}) => void no Called after an animation frame was drawn. afterEvent (chartInstance: Chart, event: Event, options?: {}) => void no Called after an event occurs on the chart. afterInit (chartInstance: Chart, options?: {}) => void no Called after a chart initializes afterLayout (chartInstance: Chart, options?: {}) => void no Called after the chart layout was rendered. afterRender (chartInstance: Chart, options?: {}) => void no Called after a render. afterTooltipDraw (chartInstance: Chart, tooltipData?: {}, options?: {}) => void no Called after drawing the tooltip . Note that this hook will not be called if the tooltip drawing has been previously cancelled. afterUpdate (chartInstance: Chart, options?: {}) => void no Called after a chart updates beforeDatasetsDraw (chartInstance: Chart, easing: string, options?: {}) => void no Called before the datasets are drawn but after scales are drawn. Cancellable. beforeDatasetUpdate (chartInstance: Chart, options?: {}) => void no Called before a dataset is updated.

Cancellable. beforeInit (chartInstance: Chart, options?: {}) => void no Called before a chart initializes beforeLayout (chartInstance: Chart, options?: {}) => void no Called before rendering the chart's layout. Cancellable. beforeRender (chartInstance: Chart, options?: {}) => void no Called at the start of a render. It is only called once, even if the animation will run for a number of frames. Use beforeDraw or afterDraw to do something on each animation frame. Cancellable. beforeTooltipDraw (chartInstance: Chart, tooltipData?: {}, options?: {}) => void no Called before drawing the tooltip . Cancellable. If it returns false , tooltip drawing is cancelled until another render is triggered. beforeUpdate (chartInstance: Chart, options?: {}) => void no Called before updating the chart.

Lack of basic style , such as fonts, for basic HTML elements when creating web parts hosted in Teams as Tabs or personal App . Lack of basic style, such as fonts, for basic HTML elements when creating web parts in \"isDomainIsolated\" mode , aka the Isolated web parts. Therefore, the control is to be considered as a sort of wrapper for all react and non-react controls that you want to add to the web part. The control extends the functionality of the Fluent UI ThemeProvider control (currently in version 7) by adding some logic thanks to the information contained in the 'context' property, that is: If the web part is hosted inside SharePoint, the theme passed through the 'Theme' property will be used or the default one of the current site will be taken. If the web part is hosted within Teams, the \"Theme\" property will be ignored and using the \"Context\" property checks which theme is currently applied and adds a handler to notify when the theme is changed. This allows you to manage the change of theme in Teams in real-time, without having to reload the Tab or the Personal App. Example of use in SharePoint in a SharePointFullPage - Isolated web parts (note that the titles H1, H2, H3 and the paragraph are normal html tags that automatically take the font and color style from the control): As for Teams, given the inconsistency of the theme system of Fluent UI NorthStar (used in Teams) and Fluent UI React (used by SPFx), the themes are \"emulated\".

Example Usage \u00b6 To create a bar chart, add the ChartControl import: import { ChartControl , ChartType } from '@pnp/spfx-controls-react/lib/ChartControl' ; Then render the ChartControl: < ChartControl type = { ChartType . Bar } data = { data } options = { options } /> For example, to render the chart above, use the following code: // set the data const data : Chart.ChartData = { labels : [ 'January' , 'February' , 'March' , 'April' , 'May' , 'June' , 'July' ], datasets : [{ label : 'My First Dataset' , data : [ 65 , 59 , 80 , 81 , 56 , 55 , 40 ], backgroundColor : [ 'rgba(255, 99, 132, 0.2)' , 'rgba(255, 159, 64, 0.2)' , 'rgba(255, 205, 86, 0.2)' , 'rgba(75, 192, 192, 0.2)' , 'rgba(54, 162, 235, 0.2)' , 'rgba(153, 102, 255, 0.2)' , 'rgba(201, 203, 207, 0.2)' ], borderColor : [ 'rgb(255, 99, 132)' , 'rgb(255, 159, 64)' , 'rgb(255, 205, 86)' , 'rgb(75, 192, 192)' , 'rgb(54, 162, 235)' , 'rgb(153, 102, 255)' , 'rgb(201, 203, 207)' ], borderWidth : 1 }] }; // set the options const options : Chart.ChartOptions = { scales : { yAxes : [ { ticks : { beginAtZero : true } } ] } }; return ( < ChartControl type = { ChartType . Bar } data = { data } options = { options } /> ); You can omit the backgroundColor , borderColor , and borderWidth values from the code above to render a chart using the default Office palette: // set the data const data : Chart.ChartData = { labels : [ 'January' , 'February' , 'March' , 'April' , 'May' , 'June' , 'July' ], datasets : [{ label : 'My First Dataset' , data : [ 65 , 59 , 80 , 81 , 56 , 55 , 40 ] }] }; // set the options const options : Chart.ChartOptions = { scales : { yAxes : [ { ticks : { beginAtZero : true } } ] } }; return ( < ChartControl type = { ChartType . Bar } data = { data } options = { options } /> ); Which will produce the following chart: As with all charts, the backgroundColor and borderColor values can be one of the following: Array of colors ( string[] ): each data element in the dataset will be assigned a different color in the same order as they are listed in the array. If there are more data elements than colors, the remaining data elements will have a grey color. A single color ( string ): every data element in the dataset will use the same color. Variations \u00b6 Stacked Bar Chart \u00b6 If your bar chart has multiple datasets, you can render it as a stacked bar chart by changing the settings on the X and Y axes to enable stacking, as follows: const options : Chart.ChartOptions = { scales : { xAxes : [{ stacked : true }], yAxes : [{ stacked : true }] } }; In order to render each dataset with a different color, make sure to specify the backgroundColor and borderColor settings for each dataset: const data : Chart.ChartData = { labels : [ 'January' , 'February' , 'March' , 'April' , 'May' , 'June' , 'July' ], datasets : [ { label : 'My First Dataset' , data : [ 65 , 59 , 80 , 81 , 56 , 55 , 40 ], fill : false , backgroundColor : 'rgba(255, 99, 132, 0.2)' , // same color for all data elements borderColor : 'rgb(255, 99, 132)' , // same color for all data elements borderWidth : 1 }, { label : 'My Second Dataset' , data : [ 15 , 29 , 30 , 8 , 26 , 35 , 20 ], fill : false , backgroundColor : 'rgba(255, 159, 64, 0.2)' , // same color for all data elements borderColor : 'rgb(255, 159, 64)' , // same color for all data elements borderWidth : 1 } ] }; Horizontal Bar Chart \u00b6 To render a horizontal bar, use the following code: < ChartControl type = { ChartType . HorizontalBar } data = { data } options = { options } /> Using the same options as above. Note that horizontal bar charts can also be stacked using the same approach as above. Dataset Properties \u00b6 Bar charts allow each dataset to have different configuration properties. Some properties can be provided as arrays. When arrays are provided, the settings in the array will be applied to each data element in the same order (e.g.: first value applies to first element, second value to second element, etc.) For example, the following code will apply the value 'red:' to every element in the dataset. const data : Chart.ChartData = { datasets : [ { label : 'My First Dataset' , data : [ 10 , 20 , 30 , ], backgroundColor : 'red' } }; Whereas the following code will set 10 to backgroundColor 'red' , 20 to 'green' , and 30 to 'blue' . const data : Chart.ChartData = { datasets : [ { label : 'My First Dataset' , data : [ 10 , 20 , 30 , ], backgroundColor : [ 'red' , 'green' , 'blue' ] } }; Name Type Description label string Dataset label. Appears in the legend and tooltips. xAxisID string The axis ID for the X axis. If not specified, the dataset will be rendered on the first available X axis. If an ID is specified, the dataset will be rendered on that axis yAxisID string The axis ID for the Y axis. If not specified, the dataset will be rendered on the first available Y axis. If an ID is specified, the dataset will be rendered on that axis backgroundColor Color OR Color[] The bar fill color. borderColor Color OR Color[] The bar border color. borderWidth number OR number[] The bar's border width. Measured in pixels. borderSkipped 'bottom' 'left' 'top' 'right' Specifies which border should be hidden when rendering bars. This option is useful when custom-rendering charts. data number[] { t: Date, y: number} The chart's data. Required. hoverBackgroundColor Color OR Color[] The bar's fill color when a mouse hovers over it hoverBorderColor Color OR Color[] The bar's border color when a mouse hovers over it. hoverBorderWidth number OR number[] The bar's border width when a mouse hovers over it. Data Structure \u00b6 number[] \u00b6 The data property of each dataset item consists of an array of numbers. Each point in the array corresponds to the matching label on the x axis: data : [ 20 , 10 , 33 , 47 ] The chart elements will be rendered in the same order as found in the array. Time Scales \u00b6 You can also provide dates and times instead of labels for each data element. Time scales should be provided as t (as in ticks ) and y coordinates: data : [ { \"t\" : new Date ( 'December 1 2018' ), \"y\" : 46 }, { \"t\" : new Date ( 'December 3 2018' ), \"y\" : 9 }, { \"t\" : new Date ( 'December 7 2018' ), \"y\" : 48 }, { \"t\" : new Date ( 'December 10 2018' ), \"y\" : 13 }, { \"t\" : new Date ( 'December 20 2018' ), \"y\" : 12 }, ] Or, if you prefer using moment.js : data : [ { \"t\" : moment ( 'December 1 2018' ). valueOf (), \"y\" : 46 }, { \"t\" : moment ( 'December 3 2018' ). valueOf (), \"y\" : 9 }, { \"t\" : moment ( 'December 7 2018' ). valueOf (), \"y\" : 48 }, { \"t\" : moment ( 'December 10 2018' ). valueOf (), \"y\" : 13 }, { \"t\" : moment ( 'December 20 2018' ). valueOf (), \"y\" : 12 }, ] (add the following to your imports:) import * as moment from 'moment' ; To render horizontal axis as a time series, use the following options: options = {{ scales : { xAxes : [{ type : 'time' , time : { displayFormats : { // choose the scale that applies to your data, // or pass all the scales 'millisecond' : 'MMM DD YYYY' , // use your own date format 'second' : 'MMM DD YYYY' , 'minute' : 'MMM DD YYYY' , 'hour' : 'MMM DD YYYY' , 'day' : 'MMM DD YYYY' , 'week' : 'MMM DD YYYY' , 'month' : 'MMM DD YYYY' , 'quarter' : 'MMM DD YYYY' , 'year' : 'MMM DD YYYY' , } } }] } }} Which will produce the following chart: NOTE: As with regular data elements, you should pass the time scale array in the order that you want them to appear. Otherwise, you will get disappointing results. Configuration \u00b6 The following configuration options are specific to bar charts: Name Type Default Description barPercentage number 0.9 How much of the category should each bar occupy, in percent. Value should be between 0 and 1. categoryPercentage number 0.8 How much each category should occupy, in percent. Value should be between 0 and 1. barThickness number OR \"flex\" Sets the thickness of each bar. If the default value is used, the bars will be equally sized to match the smallest interval. If number value is provided, the bar width will be set in pixels and barPercentage and categoryPercentage will be ignored. If \"flex\" is used, the widths are calculated automatically based on the previous and following samples so that they take the full available widths without overlap maxBarThickness number Sets the maximum width of every bar. gridLines.offsetGridLines boolean true true , bars will fall between the grid lines; grid lines will shift to the left by half a tick interval.

Usage \u00b6 The main scenario to use this package is to import FieldRendererHelper class and to call getFieldRenderer method. This method returns a Promise with a proper field renderer ( Promise<JSX.Element> ) based on field's type. It means that it will automatically select proper component that should be rendered in this or that field. This method also contains logic to correctly process field's value and get correct text to display (for example, Friendly Text for DateTime fields). As the method returns Promise it should be called in one of React component lifecycle methods, for example, componentWillMount that will occur before render . The resulting field renderer could be saved in the element's state and used later in render method. Here is an example on how it can be used inside custom Field Customizer component (.tsx file): export interface IOotbFieldsState { fieldRenderer? : JSX.Element ; } //... @override public componentWillMount () { FieldRendererHelper . getFieldRenderer ( this . props . value , { className : this.props.className , cssProps : this.props.cssProps }, this . props . listItem , this . props . context ). then ( fieldRenderer => { this . setState ({ fieldRenderer : fieldRenderer }); }); } public render () : React .

Before you submit your first PR, please read the following guide. We'd hate to see you work on something that someone else is already working on, something that we agreed not to do or something that doesn't match the project. Sharing is caring! You have an idea for a new component \u00b6 Awesome! Good ideas are invaluable for every product. Before you start hacking away, please check if there is no similar idea already listed in the issue list . If not, please create a new issue describing your idea. Once we agree on the feature scope and architecture, the feature will be ready for building. Don't hesitate to mention in the issue if you'd like to build the feature yourself. When building a new control, try to add your control to the default provided web part so that everyone can test it out. Please also provide the documentation for your controls in the documentation section . You have a suggestion for improving an existing component \u00b6 Nothing is perfect. If you have an idea how to improve an existing command or the CLI, let us know by submitting an issue in the issue list . Some things are done for a reason, but some are not. Let's discuss what you think and see how the project could be improved for everyone. You've found a bug \u00b6 Bugs happen. When you find a bug, please have a look at the issue list if a similar bug has already been logged. If not, let us know what doesn't work and how we can reproduce it. If we can't reproduce your bug, we will ask you for clarification, which will only make it longer to fix it. Fixing typos \u00b6 Typos are embarrassing! Most PR's that fix typos will be accepted immediately. In order to make it easier to review the PR, please narrow the focus instead of sending a huge PR of fixes. Tips \u00b6 Before contributing: ensure that the dev branch on your fork is in sync with the original sp-dev-fx-controls-react repository # assuming you are in the folder of your locally cloned fork.... git checkout dev # assuming you have a remote named `upstream` pointing to the official **sp-dev-fx-controls-react** repo git fetch upstream # update your local dev to be a mirror of what's in the main repo git pull --rebase upstream dev create a feature branch for your change. If you'll get stuck on an issue or merging your PR will take a while, this will allow you to have a clean dev branch that you can use for contributing other changes git checkout -b my-contribution DO's & DON'Ts \u00b6 DO follow the same project and test structure as the existing project. DO include tests when adding new functionality and features. When fixing bugs, start with adding a test that highlights how the current behavior is broken. DO keep discussions focused.

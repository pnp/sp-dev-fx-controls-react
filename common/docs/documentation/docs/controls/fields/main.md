## Usage

The main scenario to use this package is to import `FieldRendererHelper` class and to call `getFieldRenderer` method. This method returns a Promise with a proper field renderer (`Promise<JSX.Element>`) based on field's type. It means that it will automatically select proper component that should be rendered in this or that field. This method also contains logic to correctly process field's value and get correct text to display (for example, Friendly Text for DateTime fields).
As the method returns `Promise` it should be called in one of React component lifecycle methods, for example, `componentWillMount` that will occur before `render`. The resulting field renderer could be saved in the element's state and used later in `render` method.
Here is an example on how it can be used inside custom Field Customizer component (.tsx file):

```TypeScript
export interface IOotbFieldsState {
  fieldRenderer?: JSX.Element;
}

//...

@override
  public componentWillMount() {
    FieldRendererHelper.getFieldRenderer(this.props.value, {
      className: this.props.className,
      cssProps: this.props.cssProps
    }, this.props.listItem, this.props.context).then(fieldRenderer => {
      this.setState({
        fieldRenderer: fieldRenderer
      });
    });
  }

public render(): React.ReactElement<{}> {
    return (
      <div className={styles.cell}>
        {this.state.fieldRenderer}
      </div>
    );
  }
```

Additionally, any of included components can be used by itself.

## FieldRendererHelper

[FieldRendererHelper](./FieldRendererHelper.md) class is a **recommended** way to use Field Controls as it provides additional functionality to automatically render the content for any type of fields.

# Reusable React controls for your SharePoint Framework solutions ![](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@pnp/spfx-controls-react.svg)

This repository provides developers with a set of reusable React controls that can be used in SharePoint Framework (SPFx) solutions. The project provides controls for building web parts and extensions.

![Placeholder example](./assets/placeholder-intro.png)

!!! attention
    The controls project has a minimal dependency on SharePoint Framework version `1.3.0`. Be aware that the controls might not work in solutions your building for on-premises. As for on-premises solutions version `1.1.0` is currently used.

## Getting started

### Installation

To get started you have to install the following dependency to your project: `@pnp/spfx-controls-react`.

Enter the following command to install the dependency to your project:

```bash
npm install @pnp/spfx-controls-react --save --save-exact
```

### Configuration

!!! note
    Since `v1.4.0` the localized resource path will automatically be configured during the dependency installing.

Once the package is installed, you will have to configure the resource file of the property controls to be used in your project. You can do this by opening the `config/config.json` and adding the following line to the `localizedResources` property:

```json
"ControlStrings": "node_modules/@pnp/spfx-controls-react/lib/loc/{locale}.js"
```

# People Picker

This control renders a People picker field which can be used to select one or more users from a SharePoint group or site. The control can be configured as mandatory. It will show a custom error message if field is empty.

## How to use this control in your solutions

- Check that you installed the `@pnp/spfx-controls-react` dependency. Check out the [getting started](../#getting-started) page for more information about installing the dependency.
- Import the following modules to your component:

```typescript
import { PeoplePicker, PrincipalType } from "@pnp/spfx-controls-react/lib/PeoplePicker";
```

- Use the `PeoplePicker` control in your code as follows:

```typescript
<PeoplePicker
    context={this.props.context}
    titleText="People Picker"
    personSelectionLimit={3}
    groupName={"Team Site Owners"} // Leave this blank in case you want to filter from all users
    showtooltip={true}
    isRequired={true}
    disabled={true}
    selectedItems={this._getPeoplePickerItems}
    showHiddenInUI={false}
    principalTypes={[PrincipalType.User]}
    resolveDelay={1000} />
```

- With the `selectedItems` property you can get the selected People in the Peoplepicker :

```typescript
private _getPeoplePickerItems(items: any[]) {
  console.log('Items:', items);
}
```

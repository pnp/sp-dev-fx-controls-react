# ViewPicker control

This control allows you to select available views from lists/libraries of the current site.

Here is an example of the control:

![ViewPicker initial](../assets/ViewPicker1.PNG)

`ViewPicker` single selection mode:

![ViewPicker single selection](../assets/ViewPicker2.png)

`ViewPicker` multi selection mode:

![ViewPicker multi selection](../assets/ViewPicker-multi.png) 


## How to use this control in your solutions

- Check that you installed the `@pnp/spfx-controls-react` dependency. Check out the [getting started](../../#getting-started) page for more information about installing the dependency.
- Import the control into your component:


```TypeScript
import { ViewPicker } from "@pnp/spfx-controls-react/lib/ViewPicker";
```

- Use the `ViewPicker` control in your code as follows:

```TypeScript
    <ViewPicker context={this.props.context}
        listId={"9f3908cd-1e88-4ab3-ac42-08efbbd64ec9"}
        placeholder={'Select list view(s)'}
        orderBy={orderBy.Title}
        multiSelect={true}
        onSelectionChanged={this.onViewPickerChange} />
```

- The `onSelectionChanged` change event returns the selected view(s) and can be implemented as follows in your webpart:

```TypeScript
  private onViewPickerChange = (views: string | string[]) => {
    console.log("Views:", views);
  }
```

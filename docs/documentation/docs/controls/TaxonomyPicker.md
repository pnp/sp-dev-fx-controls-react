# Taxonomy Picker

This control allows you to select one or more Terms from a TermSet via its name or TermSet ID. You can also configure the control to select the child terms from a specific term in the TermSet by setting the AnchorId.

!!! note "Disclaimer" 
    This control makes use of the `ProcessQuery` API end-points to retrieve the managed metadata information. This will get changed once the APIs for managing managed metadata will become available.

## How to use this control in your solutions

- Check that you installed the `@pnp/spfx-controls-react` dependency. Check out the [getting started](../#getting-started) page for more information about installing the dependency.
- Import the following modules to your component:

```TypeScript
import { TaxonomyPicker, IPickerTerms } from "@pnp/spfx-controls-react/lib/TaxonomyPicker";
```

- Use the `TaxonomyPicker` control in your code as follows:

```TypeScript
<TaxonomyPicker allowMultipleSelections={true}
                termsetNameOrID="Countries"
                panelTitle="Select Term"
                label="Taxonomy Picker"
                context={this.props.context}
                onChange={this.onTaxPickerChange}
                isTermSetSelectable={false} />
```

- With the `onChange` property you can capture the event of when the terms in the picker has changed:

```typescript
private onTaxPickerChange(terms : IPickerTerms) {
    console.log("Terms", terms);
}
```

## Term actions

Since version `1.12.0`, you can apply term actions to all terms or specific ones. Term actions could for instance be used to retrieve the labels of the term, or retrieve other information. These term actions can be implemented as follows:

```typescript
<TaxonomyPicker allowMultipleSelections={true}
                termsetNameOrID="Countries"
                panelTitle="Select Term"
                label="Taxonomy Picker"
                context={this.props.context}
                onChange={this.onServicePickerChange}
                isTermSetSelectable={false}
                termActions={{
                  actions: [{
                    title: "Update term label",
                    iconName: "LocaleLanguage",
                    id: "UpdateTermLabel",
                    actionCallback: async (taxService: SPTermStorePickerService, term: ITerm) => {
                      return {
                        updateActionType: UpdateType.updateTermLabel,
                        value: `${term.Name} (updated)`
                      };
                    },
                    applyToTerm: (term: ITerm) => (true) // Applying the action to all terms
                  }]
                }} />
```

![Term action sample](../assets/term-action.png)

We also provided a default term action which you can use to retrieve the term its labels and will update the term text in the TaxonomyPicker hierarchy.

```typescript
<TaxonomyPicker allowMultipleSelections={true}
                termsetNameOrID="Countries"
                panelTitle="Select Term"
                label="Taxonomy Picker"
                context={this.props.context}
                onChange={this.onServicePickerChange}
                isTermSetSelectable={false}
                termActions={{
                  actions: [new TermLabelAction("Get Labels")]
                }} />
```
